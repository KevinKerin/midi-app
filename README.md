Piano for Beginners is a web-based application which provides the necessary functionality to connect a userâ€™s device to a MIDI-compatible piano. It allows the user to learn basic chords and scales, and gives the user the ability to save, edit, playback and download any musical pieces that they create.

Piano for Beginners incorporates an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) for its users. The simple design allows users to begin playing right away. The app purposely incorporates a design scheme which accentuates the on-screen piano, and highlights any key that the user plays which allow for maximum learning.

This free web-based application gives users an amazing product which they can use anywhere in the world. Beginners can save money on expensive piano lessons by using the playback function to analyse which area they need to focus on. Intermediate musicians can gain confidence by sharing fully cross-platform functional MIDI files of their latest practise recordings with their friends. Advanced musicians can save pre-recorded playlists on their account and then access it through their phone or computer when gigging. While this is an application aimed at beginners, it really can be used by just about anyone interested in music.
